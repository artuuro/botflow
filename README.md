# BotFlow
JavaScript (nodejs) library that accepts `Twilio Studio` alike JSON configuration files and provides the same functionality on an independent back-end service.

### Features
- Data gathering over a bot-conversation & sending to remotes;
- Sending message to client & awaiting for response to continue the flow;
- Message templating and variable injection using handlebars;
- Action Triggers `split-based-on`, `send-message`, `make-http-request` (see usecases at `/examples/*`);
- Condition triggers `regex`, `equal_to`, `not_equal_to`, `matches_any_of` (see usecases at `/examples/json/*`);
- Populates remote response data into scope;

### How to?
- Install yarn globally with `npm i -g yarn`;
- Ideally you'd like to build it with `yarn build` and import from `/bin`;
  - Run example survey: `yarn test:survey`;
  - Run example appointment: `yarn test:appointment`;

- You can also `npm i botflow` then use following example:
```
const BotFlow = require('botflow');
const Configuration = require('./JSON_CONFIG_FILE_PATH.json');

const instance = new BotFlow(
  {
    From: 'SENDER_ID/NAME/REFERENCE',
    To: 'RECEIVER_ID/NAME/REFERENCE'
  }, 
  Configuration
);

(async () => {
  
  const reply = await instance.query('start');

  console.log(reply);

  console.log(instance);
 
})();
```
